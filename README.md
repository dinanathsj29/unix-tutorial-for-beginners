1 Introduction to Operating System
=====================

In this section, you will be able to understand the fundamentals of Operating Systems, its functions and various Operating Systems used in the world.

1.1. What is the Operating System
---------------------
1.1. What is OS (Operating System)
---------------------

- OS (Operating System) is a set of programs/package acts as an intermediary/interface between computer software, end-user and computer hardware
- An operating system (OS) is a collection of `system software` that manages `computer hardware, software resources`, and provides common services for computer programs
- Programs which helps to manage/communicate between software and hardware (low-level software manages hardware by controlling the execution of programs)
- Core/brain/heart of machine's/device's software and provide an environment to execute programs
- OS (Operating System) controls the allocation of resources and services such as (Memory, Processor, Devices, Information, controlling attached devices/peripherals)

1.2. Functions of Operating System
---------------------

**Here is the list of important functions performed by an Operating System**:

- Co-ordination between Software and Hardware
- Memory Management
- Device Management
- Processor Management
- Security
- Error detection
- Co-ordination between User and Software
- Control over system performance
- Task/Internal Job scheduling
- File Management

1.3. Popular Operating System
---------------------

**Here are some popular and widely used Operating Systems (OS) - Some popular Operating Systems include**:

- Unix
- DOS
- Microsoft Windows
- macOS (Apple mac)
- Linux (Unix clone)
- Android (Mobile OS)
- iOS (Apple Mobile OS - iPhone, iPad, iPod)

2 Introduction to Unix
=====================
 
In this section, you will be able to understand the basic concepts-history of Unix operating systems, features of Unix, along with its comparison, similarities and difference between other Operating Systems in the market like MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

2.1. History of Unix Operating System
---------------------

- Unix is developed by `Ken Thompson` and `Dennis Richie` at `AT&T Bell Laboratories Research Center, USA` in the year `1969`
- Unix is multi-user, multi-tasking, and multi-processing, high-function, interactive Operating System
- Unix is terminal ie. command prompt based `Command Line Interface/Interpreter (CLI)`, UNIX system also have a `Graphical User Interface (GUI)` similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment
- Initially, Unix was written in Assembly language, First Operating System is written in HLL ie. High-Level Language (C)
- Originally Unix is spelled as `UNICS (Uniplexed Information Computing System/Service)`
- Later Unix is re-written in `C` language and renamed as `Unix`
- Some of Unix OS ie. distributions are Free (Open Source - Linux) and some are not free (license needed)

2.2. Features of Unix
---------------------

**Mentioned below the features and capabilities supported by Unix Operating System**:

- Multi-user capability
- Multi-tasking
- Multi-process
- Hierarchical File Structure / Hierarchical File System
- Open Source System
- Portability
- Programming Utility/Facility
- Communication Facility
- Security
- Tools and Utilities
- Piping (Pipes & Filters)
- Help Facility - Integrated Help
- Modularity
- Unix Shell<br/><br/>
- **Multi-user capability**
  - Multiple ie. many users can use the machine simultaneously supported via terminals/command prompt
- **Multi-tasking**
  - Multiple programs can be run at a time
- **Multi-process/Multi-processing**
  - Each user can execute multiple/many/several processes simultaneously
- **Hierarchical Structure**
  - Unix directories/folders system are present like a tree structure to support, organize and maintain files
- **Open Source System**
  - Some of Unix OS ie. distributions are Free (Open Source - Linux), users can modify source code as per needs and requirements
- **Portability**
  - Unix allows users to transfer data/information/files/folders from one system to another
- **Programming Utility/Facility**
  - Unix Shell can be used as a Programming/Scripting Language
- **Communication Facility**
  - Communication between different users is possible by using/sharing some information
- **Security**
  - Unix Operating System provides System-level security controlled by the system administrator and file-level security controlled by the owner of the file/folder
- **Tools and Utilities**
  - Supports/provide many useful tools/software/utilities used for software development
- **Piping**
  - The output of the current command can be used as an input of next command/process (last-current-next process/command can be linked/chained)
- **Help Facility - Integrated Help**
  - Unix `man` command is used to get/view any command help
- **Modularity**
  - Unix Operating System consists of multiple independent modules/programs/utilities which perform a specific task
- **Unix Shell**
  - Unix Shell a command interpreter that helps to interact with Unix OS ie the Kernel. (Shell takes input/command from a user and executes programs-run command)
  
2.3 Compare different Operating System
---------------------
2.3. Compare different Operating System (MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Unix)
---------------------
2.3. The similarity between different Operating System (MS-DOS, MS-Windows, Unix)
---------------------

**Similarity between Unix and MS-DOS**:

- `Command Line Interface CLI` / Command Terminal Window / Command Prompt
- `I/O (Input Output)` redirection concepts
- `Hierarchical directory` structure (Root directory at the top)
- Read-Write (RW) and execute permissions on files/folder
- Wildcard Character support

**Similarity between Unix and MS-Windows**:

- `Graphical User Interface (GUI) `
- `Multi-tasking` Operating System
- Built-in networking with `TCP/IP` as the standard protocol
