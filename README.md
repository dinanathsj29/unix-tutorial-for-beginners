</p>

- OS (Operating System) is a set of programs/package acts as an intermediary/interface between computer software, end-user and computer hardware
- An operating system (OS) is a collection of `system software` that manages `computer hardware, software resources`, and provides common services for computer programs
- Programs which helps to manage/communicate between software and hardware (low-level software manages hardware by controlling the execution of programs)
- Core/brain/heart of machine's/device's software and provide an environment to execute programs
- OS (Operating System) controls the allocation of resources and services such as (Memory, Processor, Devices, Information, controlling attached devices/peripherals)

> #### Hardware (Physical Devices)
- The Hardware layer of the Unix Operating System controls the use of physical system resources, such as memory manager, process manager, disk drivers, devices, and so on
- The hardware consists of all input and output peripheral devices (RAM, HDD, CPU and so on)

The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts named as `the Kernel, the Shell and the Programs`:
1. Kernel
2. Shell
3. Programs

> #### 1. Kernel
- The kernel is the hub/heart/core of Unix Operating System

> #### 2. Shell
- Shell is an interface between a User/User application and Kernel

> #### 3. Programs / User-Application Program
- Utility programs and applications are given by the user are handled in this layer

### 3.2.1. Kernel

- The kernel is the hub/heart/core of Unix Operating System
- It acts as an interface between the Hardware and Shell layer
- It allocates the time and memory to the programs and handles the communications in response to the system calls
- Most of the tasks such as memory management, task scheduling, file management, and so on are performed by Kernel
- It manages external commands in Unix
- Manages system resources, and enforce the security scheme
- Manages the machine's memory and allocates it to each active/currently running process
- Manages processor interrupts, and takes care of error handling
- Schedules the work is done by the Central Processing Unit CPU and controls how processes are executed
- Manages the creation and terminations of processes, and the communication between processes
- Allocates and manages resources used by each user
- Allows user processes, including shell commands to run Kernel instructions

### 3.2.2. Shell 

- Shell is an interface between a User/User application and Kernel
- Shell is the `command interpreter in Unix`, it supports a Command Line Interface, and also allows scripting
- It serves as the interface between the User and the Kernel, helps to interact with Unix OS ie the Kernel (Shell takes input/command from a user and executes programs-run command)
- The Shell is a Command Line Interface (CLI), As and when we type a command at the terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the corresponding program
- The Shell layer processes the user request
- Shell uses standard syntax for all the commands
- It provides a rich set of commands
- Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs and shell scripts
- A file `"/etc/shells"` contains a list of all the Shells supported and available in the system

**Different Shells available with most of the Unix variants/flavors: (Shell Types / Shell variants)**
- Bourne shell (sh)
- C shell (csh)
- Korn shell (ksh)
- TelShell (wish)
- Bourne Again Shell (bash)

### 3.2.3. Programs 
### 3.2.3. Programs / User-Application Program

- Utility programs and applications are given by the user are handled in this layer
- The commands are themselves called as programs in Unix
- There are various commands and utilities which you can make use of in your day to day activities. `cp, mv, cat` and `grep`, etc.
- Data in Unix are organized into files and files are organized into directories which are further organized into a tree-like structure called as the `file system`

4 Unix File System
=====================

This section will be discussing file management in Unix. We will dive deep into Unix File System - what exactly is the file? Unix file structure, types of files, along with directories and sub-directories.

4.1. What is File?
---------------------

`All data in Unix is organized into files`. All files are organized into directories. These directories are organized into a tree-like structure called the filesystem.

The file system is central to how Unix organizes information, and all the information that needs to be stored and retrieved uses the file system.

When you work with Unix - one way or another, you spend most of your time working with files. This tutorial will help you understand how to create and remove files, copy and rename them, create links to them, etc.

- The file is a `container for storing content, records or details, information`
- `Everything in Unix is considered as a File, including physical devices such as USB devices, CD Drives, DVD-ROMs, Floppy Disk Drives (FDD)` and so on
- Input and Output (I/O) devices are also considered to be files in Unix System
- Every file in the file system has a unique name with a `unique inode number`
- Files in the Unix system grouped into directories, same as folders in Windows environment
- On a Unix system, everything is a file, if something is not a file - it is a `process`
- File attributes are kept in a separate location in the disk, example - programs, services, texts, images and so on

4.2. Directories and Sub-directories
---------------------
- `Directory or Folder within a directory is called a Sub-directory`
- `Each directory can contain multiple directories/folders (called as sub-directories/sub-folders) and/or files (tree structure)`
- In the Unix/Linux operating system, a directory is also a file containing the names of other files
- The structure of directories having sub-directories along with files are called as tree recursive structure
- All type of operations are possible for directories and files such as create, delete, copy, move, link, print, spit, and so on
- A directory can be a file, but a file cannot be a directory since the file contains the information/records (metadata) and directory contains sub-directories and files

4.3. Types of Files
---------------------
4.3. File System in Unix
---------------------

Data in Unix are organized into files and the files are further organized into directories.

The main file types in UNIX are (In Unix, there are three basic types of files):
- Regular or Ordinary File
- Directory file
- Device or Special File
  - Raw or Character Device File
  - Block File
  - Named Pipes or FIFO
  - Link
  - Socket

### 4.3.1. Regular or Ordinary File
> Regular or Ordinary File

- `An ordinary or Regular Files is a file on the system that contains data, text, or program instructions/executable programs`
- Executable programs are the commands (`ls`, `pwd`) or scripts (`a.sh`, `setup.sh`) that we enter on the prompt
- Data can be anything, there is `no specific format enforced` in the way data is being stored
- Ordinary Files contain `ASCII (human-readable)` text, executable program binaries, program data, and much more information
- A regular file is the one that is not a directory or link, It is called as `regular` since there is nothing special about it
- Directories are organized into a tree-like structure called `files system`
- Regular files can be `visualized as the leaves in the Unix tree`

### 4.3.2. Directory file
> Directory file

- Directories are files that `contain other files and sub-directories`
- Directories store both special and ordinary files, For Windows or Mac OS users, Unix directories are equivalent to folders (Directories are just like folders in Windows operating system)
- Directories are used to organize the data by keeping closely related files all at the same place
- Kernel alone can write the directory file. When a file is added or deleted from the directory, the kernel will make an entry
- A directory is a binary file used to track and locate other files and directories
- The binary format is used so that directories containing large numbers of filenames can be searched quickly
- In a directory file, we cannot directly keep contents, records, or any information
- A directory file can be `visualized as a branch of the Unix tree`

### 4.3.3. Device or Special File
> Device or Special File

- Device or special files `represent the physical devices`
- They are used for the device I/O on Unix and Linux systems (external USB drives)
- They appear in the file system just like an ordinary file or a directory
- This type of files allow access to various devices known to the system
- Some special files provide access to hardware such as CD-ROM drives, Tape, Disc/Hard drives, Players, Modems, Ethernet Adapters, Network Interfaces, Scanners, Printers, Terminals and so on
- Other special files are similar to aliases or shortcuts and enable you to access a single file using different names
- When a process writes to a special file, the data is sent to the physical device associated with it
- Special files are not exactly files but are pointers that point to the device drivers located in the kernel
- Protection applicable to files are also applicable for physical devices

> Raw or Character Device File
  - When a character special file is used to the device I/O, `data is transferred one character at a time`
  - This type of access is called raw device access and is present in `/dev`
  - Provides a serial stream of input or output
  - Example - `Terminals`

> Block File
  - Block special file is used for the device I/O, `data is transferred in large fixed-sized blocks`
  - These files are hardware files, most of which are present in `/dev`

> Named Pipes or FIFO
  - The pipe is also called as `Named Pipe` or `FIFO (First In First Out)`
  - Pipes represent one of the simpler forms of Unix Inter-Process Communication
  - The purpose of `Pipe` is to connect I/O of two Unix processes accessing the pipe,  one of the processes uses it for output while the other one uses it for input

> Link
  - it is used for `referencing some other file of the filesystem along with the path to the referenced file`
  - They are either directory or regular file

> Socket
  - A socket file is used to `pass information between applications for communication purpose`
  - We can create a socket file by using `socket()` system call 
  - A UNIX socket also called `IPC socket (Inter-Process Communication socket)`, is a special file that allows for advanced Inter-Process Communication
  - It is similar to network stream/sockets, and all the transactions are local to the filesystem

4.4. Representation of File Types
---------------------
Given below is a table that lists the character representation for each type of files:

| Representation                     |      File Type                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| -                                  | Ordinary or Regular file              |
| D                                  | Directory                            |
| C                                  | Character Special File               |
| B                                  | Block special File                   |
| L                                  | Symbolic link                        |
| P                                  | Named pipe                           |
| S                                  | Socket                               |
|                                    |                                      | 

```

File types can be determined by using a `file` command

Syntax: $ file filename, 
        $ file *

```

```

ALIPL1008:resources dinanath$ file _1_html-proforma.html

_1_html-proforma.html: HTML document text, ASCII text

```

```

ALIPL1008:resources dinanath$ file *

_1_html-proforma.html:                            HTML document text, ASCII text
_1_notes-proforma.md:                             ASCII text
agile:                                            directory
bootstrap:                                        directory
cloud-computing:                                  directory
devops:                                           directory

```

4.5. Rules for Naming a File Directory
---------------------

File/Directory has a name by which it is identified on the system

Given below are the general rules to be followed for naming a file or a directory:

- The length of a filename should be upto `255 characters/bytes` with combinations of any characters or numbers without givin space or tab
  - File and directory name should not contain any special characters as mentioned below:
    - List of special characters not allowed/used in file/directory naming convensions: ` ~ ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) [ ] + = { } | [ ] \ < > ? , . / ; ' : "`
    - `Dash -` or `Underscore _` symbol is used to separate logical words
      > example: file-name.txt, file_name.txt
    - `DOT .` symbol is used to separate a file type extension/the last name
    - File names are case-sensitive, so it can be with the upper case as well as lower case
    - A file or a directory name should not be any UNIX command name
    - The filename starts with a `DOT .` will be a hidden file
    - File names must be unique inside the directory
    - Files and directories should be arranged hierarchically as per the requirements in a tree like-structure

4.6. Terms used in a directory
---------------------

Following are the terms used in a directory:
- Root Directory
- Home Directory
- Current or Present Directory
- The parent or Previous Directory

> Root Directory
  - `Root Directory is the apex/origin directory`
  - In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, the root directory is the `first or top-most directory in a hierarchy`
  - The root directory is a topmost directory, no directory exists above the root directory
  - It is represented by `forward slash /` symbol

> Home Directory
  - `It is the base or login directory provided to the user`
  - `Name of a home directory is usually same the user's login name (login id or user name)`
  - It is the directory on Unix-like operating systems that serves as the repository for a user's personal files, directories, and programs
  - Every user has a home directory
  - In environment variables, `$HOME` is used for displaying the path of the home directory
  - Home Directory is represented by `tilde ~` symbol

> Current or Present Directory
  - Current or Present Directory is a directory in which a `user is currently working in`
  - Command `pwd` is used for displaying the current directory path

> Parent or Previous Directory
  - The parent or previous directory is `one level higher than the current directory`
  - Every directory has a present directory expect the root directory
  - It is represented by `two executive dots ..` symbol
  - Command `cd ..` is used to go to one level up ie Parent or Previous Directory

4.7. Types of Path Name
---------------------

1. Absolute/Full Path
2. Relative/Reference Path
> Absolute/Full Path
  - The pathname that `starts with the root directory` `/` is called Absolute/Full Path (it starts with `c:/`, `d:/` or so on, its hardcoded/static full path)

> Relative/Reference Path
  - Relative path name `begins with the current directory or home directory`
  - A relative path can begin with `..` or `.` for the current directory (its reference path from current directory/location)
  
5 Unix Command
=====================

This section will discuss about UNIX commands - what is a command?, what structure we need to follow while using some of the basic Unix commands. Also will see and use some basic/essential Unix commands:

5.1. What is command?
---------------------
5.1. Unix Command usage
---------------------

- In Unix, a command is a `program that can be executed/run` 
- Basic step is: `Type any Unix command` and then `Press Enter key`
- For Windows and MAC operating system we can resembles command like a `point to the program icon that needs to run by double-clicking on it`

5.2. Rules of using Unix Commands
---------------------
- Unix command may or may not have arguments or parameter (extra options provided with the command)
- An argument can be an option or a filename
- All Unix commands always must be entered in `small case letters (lower case letters)`
- The general format for a Unix command is: `command options(s) filename(s)`
- The option is usually preceded by a `dash OR minus OR -` sign  
- Two or more options available with a command can be combined easily, like this: `ls -l -a OR ls -la`
- There must be a space or tab between the command name and options

5.3. Types of Unix Commands
---------------------

Here is a type of Unix Commands:

- Simple Command
- Complex Command
- Compound  Command

> Simple Command
- A simple command is a `common command` that can be executed by providing the command name in the command prompt
- Example: `date`, `cal`, `who`

> Complex Command
- A Complex command consists of a `command name with a list of arguments that together acts as a single command`
- Example: `who am i`

> Compound Command
- A Compound Command consists of a `list of simple and/or complex commands separated by command separator, semicolon (;)` which indicates where does a command end and begin
- Example: `date; who am i; cal`

5.4. cal
---------------------
- `cal` = `calendar`
- The `cal` command/utility `displays a simple calendar in a traditional format`
- cal command is used to display the current month's calendar
- The `ncal` command offers an alternative layout, more options and the date of Easter
- Example: 
  - command: `cal 3 2020` displays the calendar of month March 2020
  - command: `cal -y` displays calendar for complete/entire year

```

```

5.5. date 
---------------------

- date command disp`lay date in different formats and/or set system date and time`
- The date utility displays the date and time read from the kernel clock
- When used to set the date and time, both the kernel clock and the hardware clock are updated

```

ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ date
Sun Apr 26 18:59:56 IST 2020

```

5.6. history
---------------------

- `history` command displays the history ie. `list of the commands used/executed previously`/in the past with line numbers
- The option `-c` clears the history list by deleting all the entries

```

ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ history
    9  git status
   10  git pull qa
   11  git pull origin qa
   12  git status
   13  git pull origin qa
   14  clear

```

5.7. banner 
---------------------

- `banner` command `prints a  high-resolution text banner on the system console or printer`
- Banner prints a large, high-quality banner on the standard output
- The output should be printed on paper of the appropriate width, with no breaks between the pages

```

ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ banner WELCOME

```

5.8. who
---------------------

- The `who` command `display the user details who is logged in`
- `who` command `displays data about all the users who have currently logged into the system `
- The who utility `displays a list of all users currently logged on`, showing for each user the login name, tty name, the date and time of login, and hostname if not local
- `who am i` command displays the effective `username of the current user`

```

ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ who
dinanath console  Apr  6 18:06 
dinanath ttys001  Apr 27 20:33 


ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ who am i
dinanath ttys001  Apr 27 20:33 

```

5.9. fg
---------------------
- The `fg` command is used to `stop/cancel all the jobs running in the terminal (in the background)`
- Usually, `fg` command is used just before `exit` command (so that all unwanted jobs canceled and one can exit from terminal easily)
- If `exit` command responds with the message `"There are stopped jobs"` than it is advisable to enter `fg` command and then again enter `exit` command to get out of command window/terminal/prompt/bash

5.10. ls
---------------------
5.10. Listing Files
---------------------

- `ls` command is used to list the files and directories stored in the current directory

Here is the sample output of the `ls` command:

```

ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ ls

Applications	Downloads	  Music       VirtualBox VMs
Desktop		    Library		  Pictures    mongo
Documents	    Movies		  Public      mongo-data

```

The command `ls` supports the `-l` option which helps you to `get more information about the listed files`

```

ALIPL1008:~ dinanath$ ls -l
total 192

6 Unix vs Linux
=====================
6 Difference between Unix and Linux
=====================

In this section/module will find head to head differences and similarities between Unix and Linux

6.1. What is Linux?
---------------------

- Linux OS is built by `Linus Torewell` in the year 1991 ???
- The name `Linux` assigned/came from the `Linux Kernel`
- Linux is an open-source, free to use (Community Developed) operating system widely used for Computer Hardware and Software, Game Development, Tablet PCs, Mainframe computers, etc.
- Linux is replica or duplicate of Unix but does not use the actual source code of Unix

6.2. Unix vs Linux
---------------------

| Unix                               |      Linux                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Use**: <br/> The Unix OS can be used at Internet Servers, Workstations and PCs                              | <br/> Linux is used by Everyone! from Home users to developers and computer enthusiasts like as Linux can be installed easily on any devices                |
| **Development and Distribution**: <br/> Unix systems are mostly developed by AT&T (Bell Laboratories) and various commercial vendors and non-profit organizations                        | Linux is developed by Open Source development community and distributed by various vendors |
| **Architecture**: <br/>  Unix is available on PA-RISC and Itanium machines                             | <br/> Originally developed for Intel's x86 hardware, ports available for several CPU types |
| **Processor**: <br/> Unix supports x86/x64, Sparc, Power, Itanium, PA-RISC, PowerPC, and many others              | Linux has a wider variety of processors!  Several kinds of processors are used                            |
| **File System Support / Supported File Types**: <br/> Unix supports:  `jfs, gpfs, hfs, hfs+, ufs, xfs, zfs and vsfs file formats/systems`  | Linux supports:  `xfs, nfs, ufs, Ex2 to Ex4, jfs, ReiserFS and NTFS etc`  |
| **Shell Interface**: <br/> Unix originally made to work in BASH (Bourne Again SHell), supports multiple command interpreters  | Linux originally made to work in BASH (Bourne Again SHell), Now it is compatible with many including BASH, Karn and C   |
| **GUI Graphical User Interface**: <br/>  Unix initially was a Command based OS, but now it also comes with GUI knows as `Common Desktop Environment` and `Gnome`  | Linx provides two GUIs like `KDE and Gnome, But have many such as LXDE, Xfce, Unity, Mate, TWM` etc.  |
| **License and Pricing**: <br/> Different flavors of Unix have different cost/pricing structures as per the vendors  | <br/> Linux is freely distributed and downloaded through varieties of Magazines, Books and websites, etc. There are some paid versions also but pretty cheaper than windows OS  |
|                                    | |
