1.1. What is the Operating System
---------------------
1.1. What is OS (Operating System)
---------------------

- OS (Operating System) is a set of programs/package acts as an intermediary/interface between computer software, end-user and computer hardware
- An operating system (OS) is a collection of `system software` that manages `computer hardware, software resources`, and provides common services for computer programs
- Programs which helps to manage/communicate between software and hardware (low-level software manages hardware by controlling the execution of programs)
- Core/brain/heart of machine's/device's software and provide an environment to execute programs
- OS (Operating System) controls the allocation of resources and services such as (Memory, Processor, Devices, Information, controlling attached devices/peripherals)

2 Introduction to Unix
=====================
 
In this section, you will be able to understand the basic concepts-history of Unix operating systems, features of Unix, along with its comparison, similarities and difference between other Operating Systems in the market like MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

2.1. History of Unix Operating System
---------------------

- Unix is developed by `Ken Thompson` and `Dennis Richie` at `AT&T Bell Laboratories Research Center, USA` in the year `1969`
- Unix is multi-user, multi-tasking, and multi-processing, high-function, interactive Operating System
- Unix is terminal ie. command prompt based `Command Line Interface/Interpreter (CLI)`, UNIX system also have a `Graphical User Interface (GUI)` similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment
- Initially, Unix was written in Assembly language, First Operating System is written in HLL ie. High-Level Language (C)
- Originally Unix is spelled as `UNICS (Uniplexed Information Computing System/Service)`
- Later Unix is re-written in `C` language and renamed as `Unix`
- Some of Unix OS ie. distributions are Free (Open Source - Linux) and some are not free (license needed)

3.2. Unix System Architecture-Structure
---------------------

An operating system is a collection of software, each designed for a specific function. Here is a basic block diagram of a Unix system Architecture-Structure:

</p>

> #### Hardware (Physical Devices)
- The Hardware layer of the Unix Operating System controls the use of physical system resources, such as memory manager, process manager, disk drivers, devices, and so on
- The hardware consists of all input and output peripheral devices (RAM, HDD, CPU and so on)

The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts named as `the Kernel, the Shell and the Programs`:
1. Kernel
2. Shell
3. Programs

> #### 1. Kernel
- The kernel is the hub/heart/core of Unix Operating System

> #### 2. Shell
- Shell is an interface between a User/User application and Kernel

> #### 3. Programs / User-Application Program
- Utility programs and applications are given by the user are handled in this layer

### 3.2.1. Kernel

- The kernel is the hub/heart/core of Unix Operating System
- It acts as an interface between the Hardware and Shell layer
- It allocates the time and memory to the programs and handles the communications in response to the system calls
- Most of the tasks such as memory management, task scheduling, file management, and so on are performed by Kernel
- It manages external commands in Unix
- Manages system resources, and enforce the security scheme
- Manages the machine's memory and allocates it to each active/currently running process
- Manages processor interrupts, and takes care of error handling
- Schedules the work is done by the Central Processing Unit CPU and controls how processes are executed
- Manages the creation and terminations of processes, and the communication between processes
- Allocates and manages resources used by each user
- Allows user processes, including shell commands to run Kernel instructions

### 3.2.2. Shell 

- Shell is an interface between a User/User application and Kernel
- Shell is the `command interpreter in Unix`, it supports a Command Line Interface, and also allows scripting
- It serves as the interface between the User and the Kernel, helps to interact with Unix OS ie the Kernel (Shell takes input/command from a user and executes programs-run command)
- The Shell is a Command Line Interface (CLI), As and when we type a command at the terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the corresponding program
- The Shell layer processes the user request
- Shell uses standard syntax for all the commands
- It provides a rich set of commands
- Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs and shell scripts
- A file `"/etc/shells"` contains a list of all the Shells supported and available in the system

**Different Shells available with most of the Unix variants/flavors: (Shell Types / Shell variants)**
- Bourne shell (sh)
- C shell (csh)
- Korn shell (ksh)
- TelShell (wish)
- Bourne Again Shell (bash)

### 3.2.3. Programs 
### 3.2.3. Programs / User-Application Program

- Utility programs and applications are given by the user are handled in this layer
- The commands are themselves called as programs in Unix
- There are various commands and utilities which you can make use of in your day to day activities. `cp, mv, cat` and `grep`, etc.
- Data in Unix are organized into files and files are organized into directories which are further organized into a tree-like structure called as the `file system`
